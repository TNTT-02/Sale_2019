# Sale_2019
This is a data information order collected from the Kaggle website. The raw data is divided into 12 files corresponding to 12 months in 2019. My task was to clean the data and put it into 1 file Total_sale_2019. I used Power query in excel to do the following:
- Adjust the data type for each column and create new columns for year and month
- Process the years and months, create formulas to get results from daily columns
- Remove duplicate data, blank rows and data errors
